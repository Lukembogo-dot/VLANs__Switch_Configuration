VLANs and Secure Switch Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This lab exercise focused on configuring Layer 2 security features on a small enterprise network, 
including VLAN creation, switch security measures, and DHCP snooping. The goal was to 
reinforce key switching concepts in a practical, hands-on environment. Using Cisco Packet Tracer 
or compatible physical devices, we configured and secured a network involving a router, two 
switches, and two PCs.
